# Getting Started with Rucio WebUI

## Installation

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm i --legacy-peer-deps`

This step will install all the dependencies required to run both, our [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) & [React App](https://reactjs.org/).

## Getting Started with Storybook

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm run storybook`

Runs the storybook in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm run build-storybook`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

## Getting Started with Create React App

#### Environment variables

React picks up any environment variable prefixes with `REACT_APP_` specified in a `.env` file. If you wish to have/add environment variables of your own, you can copy the contents of the `.env.template` file and paste it in the blank `.env` file. Please be sure to re-run the react app before examining your environment variables. A helper function `env(<KEY>)` has also been added in `tools/utils.ts` which accepts the non-prefixed key as an argument and returns the value of the environment variable.

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
